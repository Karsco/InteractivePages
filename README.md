# InteractivePages
Example site using pure Javascript to demonstrate simple functions

This site has examples of:
  -  a form with simple validation of text fields (empty fields only) 
  -  an expanding list with content read from a JSON data file 
  -  a function getting the current date and time, showing it in the page footer 
  -  drop down menus in the navigation bar

JSON data is stored in a file called data.json in the root directory. Change the url to match the url of your root directory.
